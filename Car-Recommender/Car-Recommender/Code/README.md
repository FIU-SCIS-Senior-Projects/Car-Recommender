The 3 files in which we did all of our work on are in the Code/Website directory:

CSS        : This file contains the UX/UI design.


HTML       : This file contains all the web templates that are displayed to the user. 
Within Meteor, templates are used to create a connection between the project’s 
interface and the project’s JavaScript code. The elements inside a template, 
such as a button or a form, build an interface that users can interact with.


JavaScript  : This file contains the Java Script code and Meteor events and helpers 
associated with each template in the HTML file. Within Meteor, events and helpers 
trigger the execution of code when a user clicks on a button, submits a form, taps a 
key on their keyboard, or completes other actions, thus allowing users to interact 
with interfaces.


There was no need to install or connect to a database. By default, every Meteor 
project comes with a Mongo database. The database was automatically created under 
the name "db" and runs along the local server.
